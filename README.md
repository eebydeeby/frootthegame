# frootthegame

### This is an updated version of of FROOT! with proof-of-concept online multiplayer.

It is a 3D "whack-a-mole" game with asymmetrical mutiplayer. The host rotates fruit and the client clicks on worms to "whack" them.  

You can run the game from within the Unity editor using Parrelsync (which should already be installed), or you can build it and run two separate clients.  
Currently the hame only runs on local networks.

## How to run multiplayer
1. Get the game running with two clients. You can use the clone manager in Parrelsync to do this from within the editor.
   To activate it, go to the Toolbar at the top, Parrelsync -> Clones Manager. When the window is open, click on Add New Clone.

6. The lobbu text should indicate that the players are connected and ready to play.
7. The host should click on "Start Game."
